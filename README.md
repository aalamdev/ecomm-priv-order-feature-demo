# What is this?
An attempt at making a presentation video for a feature in our
product https://www.aalam.io/online-shop.

# Why I did this?
Making a video that looks somewhat professional one seemed to be
costing more money that I thought. Hence, I attempted this task
with the help of HTML, CSS and JS. It turned out satifactory.

# How does this work?
The HTML file t.html is the file which does all the stuff. You just
have to open this file in the browser and start recording your desktop.
Below is the animation in GIF format.
